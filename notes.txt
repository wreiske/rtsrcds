Notes:

Instead of looking up the clients steamid and community id each time, maybe it would be better to store it in a global client array?
Need to create a basic function to call for events not yet implimented.

Would it be possible to create a magic function that grabs all of the available events from (gameevents.res, serverevents.res, modevents.res) and then generate hooks for all and output all of the available data to a JSON object?

For example: 

https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Generic_Source_Server_Events#server_spawn

server_spawn
Structure:	
string	hostname	public host name
string	address	hostame, IP or DNS name
string	ip	
string	port	server port
string	game	game dir
string	mapname	map name
long	maxplayers	max players
string	os	WIN32, LINUX
bool	dedicated	true if dedicated server
bool	password	true if password protected

The "magic" function would listen for all events, once the event server_spawn happens it would automatically add each property to a json object based on the type (string, integer, boolean, etc).

Only register events from registered servers:
